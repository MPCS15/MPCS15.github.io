<h1>Personal Statement: Luis Rodriguez</h1>

<p><strong> My background:</strong></p>
<p>I’m Guatemalan and Salvadorian but was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts. I’ve went Chelsea and Malden public schools where I’ve played and participated in football and wrestling. After graduating I’ve worked in various interesting jobs where learned a bit of carpentry, welding, installing carpets, central airing systems, and much more while attending Boston College. I’m majoring in the corporate systems in business management and am currently working with my brother in his cleaning business. I also work seasonal at the TD Garden switching the floors from Celtics to Bruins or concerts/ events.</p>
  
<p><strong> My Extra-Curricular Interest, Sport or hobbies</strong><p>
<p>I’m family oriented, adventurous, love nature and Music. When I’m not working I like to play basketball, go to the gym, go to different places to eat or gamble. Seeing different sceneries from where I’ve traveled made me adore nature which gives me tranquility. I rarely play video games but definitely enjoy playing any action, adventure, racing, or sports games on the PS4 and Xbox1.</p>      

<p><strong> My Interest In Web Development</strong> </p> 
<p> My interest in web development is to understand thoroughly how to create a web page with images and videos for business purposes and maybe create one for fun.
I love learning something new and learning web development would look great on my resume for business management. Also learning to organize an ideal website for business owners and clients to easily access pictures, videos and schedule estimates or visits. </p>
<p><strong> What I Hope To Gain In This Course </strong></p>
<p>What I hope to gain in this course is to better understanding on web development
And its protocols. Also creating my own web for my brother and Friend to easily
communicate with their clients and clients able to access pictures or videos on
 previous work done from other employers.</p> 

<p><strong>Topic or Ideas I would like to Discuss and learn about</strong></p>
<p>I would like to absorb as much information and create a sort of study guide that
would be beneficial after this course.<p>
